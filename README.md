# 🎯 Flask Number Guessing Game(Project 1)

Welcome to the **Flask Number Guessing Game** – a fun and interactive web app built with Python and Flask! Guess a number between **0 and 9**, and let the server tell you if you're right — with fun visuals!

## 🚀 How It Works

- The server picks a **random number** between 0 and 9.
- You try to guess the number by entering it in the URL:  
  `http://127.0.0.1:5000/your_number`
- You'll get a response:
  - ✅ **Correct guess** – You win! 🎉
  - 🔼 **Too high** – Try again!
  - 🔽 **Too low** – Try again!
